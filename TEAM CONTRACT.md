# CS 225 Final Project Team Contract (teetajp2-swg3-eliww2-zanew2)
## **Communication**
### **1. Team Meetings**
Our team will be meeting once a week from 10-11 am on Thursdays in person at one of our group member’s houses. We will not take minutes, but we will record our progress and set weekly goals for each person. If we need to speak with each other in addition to our weekly meetings, we will use Zoom to meet virtually.
### **2. Assistance**
Our groupmates all have each other's gmail and phone numbers to connect with each other. We also have a group chat that will be used as our main source of communication. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours, and texts within 24 hours.
### **3. Respect**
Each week, someone will lead the group and ensure everyone has contributed to each decision related to the project. If a vote is not unanimous, we will go by simple majority (¾).
## **Collaboration**
### **1. Work Distribution**
Week by week, we will distribute work to be done for each member which will be decided by the whole group to make sure it is divided fairly. However, we will not be completely strict on this and will be understanding if some part is harder than expected or someone has another class they need to focus on (midterm).
### **2. Time Commitment**
While we don’t have an exact idea of how many hours a week each member should put in, we expect that the total amount of work for each week should be divided evenly amongst the group members. If in a given week one person’s task requires significantly more work than everyone else’s, we commit to coming together and helping that person so that the time spent is divided as close to evenly as possible.
### **3. Conflict Resolution**
All conflicts will be settled by the group and we will figure out the best solution together. If problems continue then we will get more serious about whatever problem there may be.
